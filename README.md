#The Abyss (Processing) for EshoFuni

A new branch hacked from the fantastic
Processing workshop by Andreas Gysin (2010-2013)

#Purpose

This new branch of The Abyss keeps most of the characteristics
of the original The Abyss, but added new implementations like OSCs
to fullfil the ideas and needs of the EshoFuni project

It keeps as a system that lets everyone contribute
with the good balance between individual and collaborative work.

#Remember:
Students could build new creatures or expand features of the abyss itself.
For beginners it was easy enough to contribute with a basic creature,
more advanced students could train their graphic skills
or even build creatures which interacted with other creatures.
A few example creatures are included.
